# Angular Vinxi demo

A simple development server which uses Vinxi and Analog's Vite plugin to serve CSR and SSR app.

## How to use?

```bash
git clone git@github.com:mgechev/angular-vinxi
cd angular-vinxi && npm i
npm start
```

Now you can visit:
- http://localhost:3000/csr for a client-side rendered app
- http://localhost:3000/ssr for a server-side rendered app
